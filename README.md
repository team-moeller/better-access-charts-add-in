# Better-Access-Charts Add-In
Add-In to insert and control a "Better Access Chart" on an Access form
# The idea
At the moment you have to setup Better Access Charts for your database at your own. The idea of this project is to provide an add-in to do the following steps:
- Insert an egde browser control on a form
- Insert the necessary code modules into the database
- Control the properties for the chart
- Insert the necessary VBA code to create the chart
# Work in progress
In its current state, the project can best be described with the words “work in progress”. Little by little it will hopefully be possible to implement the necessary steps and create a workable project.
